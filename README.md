# Student-Final-grade-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This project predicts student final grades (G3) based on factors like age, sex, school, family size, absences, etc. Before training the model, we perform data engineering and analysis, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature selection, to ensure the dataset is ready for modeling. This step involves handling missing values, normalizing or scaling features, and exploring the data for patterns and correlations. After preparing the data, we apply a Linear Regression model and evaluate its performance using metrics like MSE and RÂ². The goal is to predict academic performance based on these variables.
